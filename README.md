- initialize a monoropo via turborepo
- delete the prebuild docs folder inside /app
- in the packages folder add prisma folder, to hold all db related stuffs
    >> initialize a node project by adding a package.json
        >> name the repo as "@repo/db"
    >> add tsconfig.json file, extend it to typescript-config prebuild
    >> before that add @repo/typescript-config as a devdependency
    >> add compilorOptions rootdir to ./src, and outdir as ./dist in the tsconfig

    >> install prisma
        >> npx prisma --init >> add user model
        >> get neon db creds
        >> npx prisma migrate dev >> npx prisma generate
        >> add src/index.js >> initialize prisma client and export it
    >> add build script
    >> add export alias ./client : "./dist/index.js"
        >> so as to import the client exported from "@repo/prisma/client";

    
    - initialized a simple http and websocket server
    - connected all the apps with the common db package


# Deployment
    - create two instances (ec2)
    1. dev - to push code while development stage
    2. prod - to push the final ready application, intended for real users

    - install node (following the DO blog)
    - install nginx to both the servers
        >> sudo apt update 
        >> sudo apt install nginx
    - install pm2 to both   
        >> npm install -g pm2


    - clone the git repo
    - >> pnpm install
    - >> build the project
    - >> finally start via pm2
        >> cd http-server 
        >> pm2 start --name http-server -- run start  (to start via app script);
    - >> configure nginx   
        - /etc/nginx/sites-available/monorepo_ci_cd
        - server {
            listen 80;
            server_name 13.60.192.42;

            }
        }
        - link it
            >> sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/[created_config_filename] /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
        - finally
            >> sudo nginx -t  
            >> sudo systemctl restart nginx

    # all the processes are now successfully running on the clean urls


## CI script to deploy changes app as soon as a push happens to main branch.

1. SSH Key Pair Setup
    - generated a key pair to allow GitHub Actions to connect to EC2.
    - Used: ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "github-actions"
    - Added public key (.pub) to EC2 instance's ~/.ssh/authorized_keys.
    - Stored private key (full content including -----BEGIN...END-----) in GitHub Secrets as EC2_SSH_KEY.

2. GitHub Secrets
    EC2_SSH_KEY	-  Private SSH key for GitHub Actions to use
    EC2_HOST	-  EC2's public IP (e.g., 13.233.xxx.xxx)
    EC2_USER	-  ubuntu (vm's select OS)

3. script in .github/workflows/deploy.yaml
    name: Deploy to EC2 on push

    on:
    push:
        branches:
        - main

    jobs:

        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        - provide path to node is important, without it, process can't be run
        - as packages are though installed, but path to it is unknown, hence can't be used in github temporarily set VM (set to ssh into original remote VM)
